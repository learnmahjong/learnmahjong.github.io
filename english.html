    <h2>
      In this guide I will teach you how to play the game of Mahjong 
    </h2>
    <h4>Before beggining the guide you should know that the tiles used in the game work just like playing cards. there are 3 different suits and each suit is numbered from 1 to 9.
      however in mahjong there are an extra 2 suits which arnt numbered and are called honor tiles. the honor tiles have a dragon suit and a winds suit.
      <br><br>
      click the logo above to have a look at these tile suits anytime throughout this guide.
    </h4>
    <h1>Now lets begin</h1>
    <p>
      <span class="numbers">1.</span> To win the Mahjong game, you must complete two conditions, the first is
      to have 4 combinations of 3 pieces and a pair (14 total pieces)
    <br><span>- Combinations are of 2 types - three identical pieces also known as a
      triplet, or a sequence of 3 numbers like 3,4,5</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="numbers">2. </span>The second condition is to complete a method of winning. All methods of
      winning are listed in the table below.
    </p>
    <p><span class="numbers">3. </span>In the game of Mahjong there is a feature where you can steal pieces discarded by other players to complete your combinations
        <br><span>- If  stealing to completed a sequence this is called chi and can only be stolen from the player before you <br>- If stealing to complete a triplet this is called "Pon" and can be stolen anytime a piece is discarded then it becomes your turn <br>- If stealing to complete 4 identical tiles, this is called "Kan" this can also be done anytime but you must then draw an extra piece to balance out your pieces</span>
    <p><span class="numbers">4. </span>-If you steal a piece, you must put this newly formed combination to your right side for all players to see, and now you hand is called an open hand (which comes with some disadvatages)
    <br> <span>- The disadvantage is that some methods of winning can only be done when your play is closed, however most winning methods can be done with both open and closed hands</span></p>
    </p>
    <p><span class="numbers">5. </span>Each method of winning will give the player a certain number of 'han'.</p>
    <p><span class="numbers">6. </span>These "Han" will be converted into points at the end</p>
    <p>
        <span class="numbers">7. </span>There are two tables below, the first shows the methods of winning with closed
      play only. And the second table is for both hidden and open plays
    </p>
    <h4>
      *** P.S - The good thing about keeping your play hidden/closed without
      stealing, is that if you cant complete any of the methods of winning below, then you can go for 2 winning methods that dont have any
      requirments. <br />
      <br />
      The first one is called Riichi which only requires you to place an extra
      1000 point bet when waiting for your last winning piece. The second one is
      called Tsumo which is to win by drawing your winning piece instead of
      stealing it ***
